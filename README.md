Sample code to generate data and plots from:
Luke Hayden, Kenneth D. Poss, Alessandro De Simone, and Stefano Di Talia
Mathematical modeling of Erk activity waves in regenerating zebrafish scales


The code requires MATLAB (MathWorks) and runs in version R2020a. 
The code runs on a Lenovo Legion Y540 running Microsoft Windows 10 Home
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU @ 2.6 GHz, 16GB RAM


INSTALLATION AND USAGE
Each folder contains self-contained code which will generate data and/or plots.
All necessary external functions are contained within each folder with their licenses (when applicable)
 
The folders are named with brief descriptions of the data generated by the contained scripts.
Individual scripts contain comments in the first few lines to describe their purpose.
Scripts containing and underscore and number at the end of their names represent a sample
script in a series run on a computing cluster. Comments within the script detail the numbered series.
